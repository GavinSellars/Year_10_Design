            <div id='explainHolder'>
            <p class='explain'> Over the course of the past few months, quarantine has seen many of us
                unable to spend as much time as we might like being outside and active with 
                the various sports and programs that would normally be running. This website offers
                a way to help anyone feeling they need to spend more time exercising. 
                Using an iPhone or other device which automatically records the number of steps 
                you take each day, you can enter your number each day and look back at your 
                progress over time. You can add other friends on your site and compare your
                numbers to their's, and get competitive to see who can get the most steps each day.
                Enjoy!
            </p>
